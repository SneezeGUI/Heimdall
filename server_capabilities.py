Server Mode Detection and Advanced Feature Management for Ragnar

This module detects when Ragnar is running on a capable server (AMD64/ARM64 with 8GB+ RAM)
and unlocks advanced features that would be impossible on a Pi Zero W2.

Features unlocked in server mode:
- Advanced Vulnerability Assessment (OpenVAS, Nuclei, Nikto)
- Parallel scanning
- Large dictionary attacks
- Local AI/LLM integration

Not everything heavy-sounding belongs behind that bar. Two features have their
own, much lower gates because what they actually cost has nothing to do with
OpenVAS-class work:
- Traffic Analysis - a tcpdump pipe parsed in Python (see TRAFFIC_MIN_RAM_GB)
- The on-screen kiosk - one Chromium (see KIOSK_MIN_RAM_GB)
