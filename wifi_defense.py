wifi_defense.py — Passive 802.11 frame monitor / Wireless IDS for Ragnar.

Listens on a **monitor-mode** adapter for 802.11 management frames and flags the
classic wireless attacks a defender cares about:

* **Deauth / disassoc flood** — the 802.11 deauthentication DoS (aireplay/mdk4):
  spoofed deauth/disassoc frames knock clients off an AP.
* **Beacon flood** — a storm of fake APs (mdk4 beacon mode): many bogus SSIDs /
  BSSIDs appearing at once to drown the airspace or bait clients.
* **Rogue AP / evil twin** — a *known* SSID advertised from a BSSID that isn't in
  the trusted baseline (a look-alike AP set up to harvest clients), or one SSID
  suddenly served by two BSSIDs.
* **KARMA / MANA** — an AP that answers probe requests for *many different* SSIDs
  from a single BSSID (it pretends to be every network a client has ever joined).

Everything here only **receives** — it never transmits a frame, never deauths
anyone back. It's detection-only (a WIDS), not an attack tool.

Monitor mode is set up with plain `iw` (no aircrack-ng needed): where the driver
allows it a *separate* monitor vif is added so the box keeps its normal Wi-Fi
link; otherwise the adapter itself is switched to monitor. Tuned for the Alfa
AWUS036AXM (mt7921u) which supports a concurrent monitor vif; the Pi's onboard
brcmfmac radio does not do monitor mode at all.
