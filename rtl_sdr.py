rtl_sdr.py — sub-GHz RF via a cheap RTL-SDR dongle (RTL2832U).

The HackRF Waterfall ([[sdr_spectrum]]) covers the 2.4/5/6 GHz Wi-Fi bands. A
common RTL-SDR **cannot** reach those (it tops out ~1.7 GHz), but that lower
range is exactly where the *interesting non-Wi-Fi* world lives — the 433/868/915
MHz ISM bands packed with TPMS tyre sensors, weather stations, door/PIR
contacts, remotes and keyfobs, utility meters and doorbells. This module turns a
plug-in RTL-SDR into two receive-only tools:

  1. **ISM device scanner** — shells out to ``rtl_433 -F json`` and keeps a live
     table of every device it decodes (model, id, RSSI, and the decoded fields).
  2. **Sub-GHz waterfall** — a scrolling power-per-frequency heatmap, the same
     shape the HackRF Waterfall uses, for the bands the HackRF view doesn't
     target. Two engines feed it (chosen automatically, same frame shape):

       * **IQ FFT (real-time)** — for any span that fits a single RTL-SDR tune
         (<= ``_IQ_MAX_SPAN_HZ``) we stream raw IQ from ``rtl_sdr`` and FFT it
         continuously with numpy, exactly how SDR++/GQRX draw a waterfall. No
         retuning, so rows scroll smoothly at ``_IQ_DISPLAY_HZ``.
       * **rtl_power sweep** — the fallback for wide bands (868/915/sub-GHz full
         scans need retuning) and for hosts without ``rtl_sdr`` or numpy. It's an
         integrating sweeper, so it advances at best ~1 row/s.

Both are **receive-only** — nothing here ever transmits.

One dongle, one claim
---------------------
An RTL-SDR is a single USB device that only one program can open at a time.
``rtl_433`` and ``rtl_power`` therefore cannot run together, and — the lesson
from the HackRF view — a device probe (``rtl_test``) must never run while either
is streaming, or it knocks the capture offline. So the two modes are mutually
exclusive (starting one stops the other) and :func:`status` reports availability
from a cached probe while anything is running.
