# Ragnar CYD hybrid node

A **companion node** for a Ragnar Pi built on the cheap, ubiquitous
**ESP32‑2432S028R** — the "Cheap Yellow Display" (CYD): an ESP32‑WROOM‑32 with a
2.8" 240×320 ILI9341 touch screen.

> **This is not Ragnar running on an ESP32.** Ragnar is a Linux/Python
> application and cannot run on a WROOM‑32 (520 KB RAM, 4 MB flash, no PSRAM).
> The node is a *hybrid companion*: it shows Ragnar's status on its touch
> screen, lets you trigger a small allowlist of Ragnar actions, and scans
> 2.4 GHz with its own radio and reports the counts back to Ragnar.

## Two ways to connect it to the Pi

Set `CYD_TRANSPORT_SERIAL` in `config.h`:

- **USB-serial (default, `=1`) — one cabled unit.** Wire the CYD to the Pi over
  USB; that cable is power **and** the data link. No WiFi, no token, no
  provisioning. Turn on the **USB-serial bridge** toggle under *Ragnar Mesh →
  CYD Nodes* and it works. This is the "sits-together" build.
- **WiFi (`=0`).** The node joins your WiFi and talks to Ragnar's REST API,
  provisioned by the on-device captive portal (below).

The screen is a **native dashboard the ESP32 draws** — Ragnar can't render its
actual web page on this panel (the ESP32 owns the display). For the real web UI
on a touchscreen, use a Pi-native display + Ragnar's kiosk mode instead.

## What it does

The 2.4 GHz radio time-shares between sensing and (WiFi build) talking to Ragnar:

```
 SYNC   serial: push counts + flush taps + read status   (cable; radio stays free)
        wifi:   GET /api/cyd/status · POST ingest · POST action
      ▼
 SNIFF  WiFi promiscuous sweep ch 1..13  (beacons/probes/deauths/BSSIDs)
      ▼
 BLE    advertisement scan               (advert count)   ── loops ──
```

The screen shows the **last-synced** values — near-real-time, not continuous.
(In the serial build there's no WiFi-connect phase, so the radio sniffs more.)

Three touch tabs: **STATUS** (Ragnar's live state), **SCAN** (this node's own
2.4 GHz counts), **ACT** (buttons that queue an allowlisted action).

### Limits (be honest about the hardware)
- **2.4 GHz only** — no 5 GHz, no WiFi 6.
- WiFi and BLE share one radio; they run in separate duty‑cycle phases, never
  simultaneously at full rate.
- Resistive touch (XPT2046) — fine for big buttons, not fine‑grained gestures.

## Build & flash

### Easiest: the browser flasher

Open **`cyd_firmware/flasher/index.html`** (served over HTTPS or `localhost`,
in Chrome/Edge), plug the board in, and click **Flash**. It uses ESP Web Tools
and the committed bins under `flasher/firmware/`. No toolchain needed.

### Or build it yourself

Requires `arduino-cli`, the `esp32` core, and the **GFX Library for Arduino**
(moononournation) — the same library the other Ragnar ESP32 firmware uses.

```bash
# one-time: core + library
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
arduino-cli lib install "GFX Library for Arduino"

# config.h needs NO secrets — provisioning is done on-device (see below).

arduino-cli compile \
  --fqbn "esp32:esp32:esp32:PartitionScheme=huge_app,FlashSize=4M" \
  cyd_firmware/ragnar_cyd

arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 \
  --fqbn "esp32:esp32:esp32:PartitionScheme=huge_app,FlashSize=4M" \
  cyd_firmware/ragnar_cyd
```

> **Power:** the CYD's WiFi browns out on some PC USB ports. If it reboots when
> WiFi starts, power it from a 5 V wall charger.

To drop BLE (saves flash/RAM), set `CYD_ENABLE_BLE 0` in `config.h`.

## Connecting it (USB-serial build — the default)

No provisioning at all. Flash it, connect it to the Pi, then in Ragnar open
**Ragnar Mesh → CYD Nodes** and switch on the **USB-serial bridge** toggle.
`cyd_serial_bridge.py` (a daemon thread in the webapp) feeds the node's reports
into the same registry, dispatches its taps through the same allowlist, and
pushes status back for the display. Toggle off to release the port.

**Two ways to wire it (same UART0 either way — no firmware change):**

- **USB cable (default):** plug it into a Pi USB port. The bridge auto-detects
  it (`/dev/ttyUSB*`), so leave the **Serial port** field empty.
- **GPIO / P1 header (no USB):** the CYD's **P1** connector breaks out VIN, GND
  and UART0 (TX0/RX0). Wire it to the Pi's GPIO — logic is 3.3 V on both sides,
  so **no level shifter**:

  | CYD P1 | → | Raspberry Pi |
  |---|---|---|
  | VIN (5 V) | → | 5V |
  | GND | → | GND |
  | RX0 (IO3) | → | Pi TX (GPIO14) |
  | TX0 (IO1) | → | Pi RX (GPIO15) |

  Enable the Pi UART (`raspi-config` → Interface → Serial: login shell **off**,
  hardware **on**), then set the **Serial port** field to `/dev/serial0`.

> SPI isn't an option on this board — it only breaks out 3 free pins (one
> input-only), so a 4-wire SPI slave won't fit. UART0 is the link.
>
> If a USB port doesn't appear, the Pi user needs access to it (`dialout`
> group) — Ragnar runs as root, so this is usually a non-issue.

## Provisioning the WiFi build (on-device setup portal)

The WiFi build (`CYD_TRANSPORT_SERIAL 0`) carries **no baked-in secrets** — a
single generic image works on any node. On first boot (or when it can't connect,
or when **BOOT** is held at power-on) the node raises its own AP and serves a
setup form:

1. In Ragnar, issue a device token under **Ragnar Mesh → CYD Nodes** (or
   `POST /api/cyd/token/generate` `{"name":"cyd-01"}`) — the raw token is shown
   **once**.
2. Join the node's WiFi **`Ragnar-CYD-setup`** (password `ragnarcyd`) and open
   the `http://…` address shown on its screen.
3. Enter WiFi SSID/password, the Ragnar URL, the device token and a node name →
   **Save & reboot**. Values are stored in NVS; the node connects and appears
   under `GET /api/cyd/nodes`.

To re-provision later, hold **BOOT** while powering on to force the portal.
(Developers can still pre-seed `config.h`'s optional `CYD_*` defaults instead of
using the portal — leave them empty for the portal path.)

The node authenticates purely by the Bearer token (it is **not** a mesh peer),
and that token grants **only** the three `/api/cyd/*` device endpoints —
scoped and fail‑closed in `webapp_modern.py`'s `check_authentication()`.

## Status

- ✅ Firmware: boots, touch UI, duty‑cycle WiFi‑sniff + BLE scan, REST client.
- ✅ Ragnar: `/api/cyd/status` + `/api/cyd/ingest` live; token role wired.
- ✅ `POST /api/cyd/action` **dispatches** to the live subsystems — `watchtower_clear`
  (sync), `ble_scan` (via the Bluetooth manager), `wifi_defense_scan` (WIDS scan
  in a background thread) — and logs the outcome, visible in `/api/cyd/nodes`.
- ✅ Operator UI: **Ragnar Mesh → CYD Nodes** sub‑tab (node list with live
  counts + token generate/list/revoke).
- ✅ `/api/cyd/status` `nets_24`/`nets_5` come from the kernel's cached scan
  (`iw scan dump`, memoised 30 s — non‑disruptive).
- ✅ **USB-serial transport** (`cyd_serial_bridge.py` + a UI toggle) — a node
  cabled to the Pi, no WiFi/token. PTY-loopback verified.
- ✅ On-device captive-portal provisioning for the WiFi build (no secrets in `config.h`).
- ✅ ESP Web Tools flasher page (`flasher/index.html`) + committed bins (serial build).
- ✅ Waterfall/Mesh/WiFi screens send periodic ingest (every 15 s) so the node
  stays live in the registry instead of going stale.
