# Sub-GHz SDR (RTL-SDR)

Ragnar's **SDR** tab turns a cheap **RTL-SDR** dongle into two receive-only
sub-GHz tools. It's the low-band counterpart to the HackRF
[True-RF Waterfall](wifi-analyzer.md#true-rf-waterfall-hackrf-sdr): the RTL-SDR
**cannot** see the 2.4/5/6 GHz Wi-Fi bands (it tops out ~1.7 GHz), but the range
it *can* reach — the 433 / 868 / 915 MHz ISM bands — is where most of the
non-Wi-Fi world lives.

Everything here is **receive-only** — nothing ever transmits.

## The two tools

| Tool | Backed by | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **📡 ISM Devices** | `rtl_433 -F json` | A live table of every device it decodes — TPMS tyre-pressure sensors, weather stations, door/window & PIR contacts, remotes/keyfobs, utility meters, doorbells — with model, id, RSSI, hit count, last-seen, and the decoded fields. |
| **📈 Sub-GHz Waterfall** | `rtl_sdr` IQ FFT (+ `rtl_power` fallback) | A scrolling power-vs-frequency heatmap (same look as the HackRF Waterfall) over 433 / 868 / 915 MHz or a wide **300–960 MHz** sweep. Raw energy only — no decode — for spotting activity, carriers and jammers below 1.7 GHz. Narrow spans (zoom / manual tune / mesh overlays, ≤~2.8 MHz) stream raw IQ and FFT continuously for a **real-time ~16 rows/s** waterfall like SDR++; wide full-band scans fall back to the slower `rtl_power` sweep. See [RF Waterfall page](rf-waterfall.md#sub-ghz-engine-real-time-iq-fft-vs-rtl_power-sweep). |

## One dongle, one claim

An RTL-SDR is a single USB device only one program can open at a time. So the
two tools are **mutually exclusive** — starting one stops the other — and the
tab reflects that automatically. The same rule is why a device probe
(`rtl_test`) is never run while a capture is streaming: opening the dongle a
second time would knock the capture offline (the lesson learned from the HackRF
view). While anything is running, `/status` reports availability from a cached
probe instead of touching the bus.

## Hardware

Any **RTL2832U**-based dongle works — Ragnar shells out to the standard
`rtl_power` / `rtl_433` / `rtl_test`, so it's brand-agnostic. Tested/supported
families, with what Ragnar shows for each:

| Dongle | Tuner | Ragnar shows | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RTL-SDR Blog V3** (RTL-SDR.com) | R820T2 | `RTL-SDR Blog V3` | TCXO, HF direct-sampling, software bias-tee. Works with the stock driver. |
| **RTL-SDR Blog V4** (RTL-SDR.com) | **R828D** | `RTL-SDR Blog V4` ⚠ | **Needs the RTL-SDR Blog librtlsdr fork** — the stock distro driver mis-tunes the R828D (see below). |
| **Nooelec NESDR** (SMArt / Nano / Mini 2+) | R820T2 | `Nooelec NESDR …` | TCXO models recommended. Works with the stock driver. |
| **Generic RTL2832U** (R820T / R820T2 / R860) | R820T/T2 | `RTL-SDR (R820T2)` | Any no-name stick. Works with the stock driver. |

Ragnar identifies the dongle from its USB product string and tuner chip
(`rtl_sdr.py` → `identify_model`). When a vendor flashed an EEPROM string
("Blog V4", "NESDR SMArt", …) that name is used verbatim; otherwise the tuner
chip decides (an **R828D** tuner is reported as a Blog V4).

The dongle draws real USB current — a **powered USB hub** is recommended on the
Pi (see the undervoltage note in the HackRF section). Leaving the tab, or
switching modes, stops the capture and frees the dongle.

**The tab's buttons stay greyed until Ragnar detects a dongle.** It polls
`/api/net/rtl/status` and un-greys once `rtl_test -t` answers.

Install the tools (done by `install_ragnar.sh`, ensured by `update_ragnar.sh`):

```bash
sudo apt install rtl-sdr rtl-433
```

The installer/updater also **blacklists the DVB-T kernel driver**
(`dvb_usb_rtl28xxu`, via `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-rtl-sdr.conf`) that would
otherwise grab the dongle before `rtl_*` can, and unloads it on the spot so a
plugged-in stick works without a reboot. If you set one up by hand: blacklist
that module, replug, and confirm with `rtl_test -t`.

### RTL-SDR Blog V4 (R828D) driver

The V4 swapped the R820T2 tuner for an **R828D**, which the *stock* Debian /
Raspberry Pi OS `librtlsdr` does not tune correctly — the sweep appears but lands
on the wrong frequencies. The V4 needs the **RTL-SDR Blog fork** of `librtlsdr`.
Ragnar detects the R828D tuner and flags it in the SDR tab ("⚠ needs Blog
driver"). To install the fork:

```bash
sudo apt purge -y ^librtlsdr        # remove the stock lib
sudo apt install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev git cmake pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/rtlsdrblog/rtl-sdr-blog
cd rtl-sdr-blog && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON && make -j"$(nproc)"
sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
```

The V3, Nooelec and generic (R820T2) dongles need none of this — they work with
the stock driver as soon as the DVB blacklist is in place.

### Troubleshooting "not detected"

The fastest path is the **🩺 SDR check** button in the Wi-Fi Spectrum Analyzer
(always available, even with no dongle). It calls `/api/net/rtl/diagnose`, which
walks every layer detection depends on and prints a one-line verdict plus the
exact fix — "no dongle on the USB bus (power/cable)", "tools not installed", or
"DVB-T driver holding it".

**Ragnar recovers a stuck or silent dongle by itself** — it power-cycles the USB
port the dongle is stuck on and restarts the sweep — and the check reports what
that watcher is doing, with the kernel's own evidence when the dongle keeps
dropping out (see [self-healing](rf-waterfall.md#when-the-dongle-stops-responding--self-healing)).
It also shows **⭮ Recover now**.

When the fix is server-side (tools missing, or the DVB-T driver holding the
device), the check shows a one-click button — **⬇ Install RTL-SDR tools** /
**🔓 Free the dongle** — that POSTs to `/api/net/rtl/install`, which apt-installs
`rtl-sdr` + `rtl-433`, writes the DVB blacklist and unloads the DVB-T driver
(runs as the service user), then re-runs the check. The manual equivalents are
below.

Detection runs a ladder (`rtl_sdr.py` → `detect`): `rtl_test -t` to open the
radio, then an `lsusb` VID:PID fallback (`0bda:2838`/`2832` and common rebadges)
so a plugged-in dongle is still reported when the tools are missing or the DVB
driver is holding it. That lets `/status` tell three cases apart:

- **`usb_id: null`, `device_present: false`** — the dongle is **not on the USB
  bus at all**. This is below Ragnar: check power and the cable/port. RTL-SDR
  dongles (NESDR SMArt especially, with its TCXO + LNA) draw ~300 mA; on a Pi
  that's browning out (`vcgencmd get_throttled` != `0x0`) the port may fail to
  enumerate it. Use a solid PSU + a **powered USB hub**, a *data* cable (not
  charge-only), and confirm with `lsusb` that a `Realtek ... RTL283x` line shows.
- **`device_present: true` but `available: false`** — the dongle *is* on the bus
  but `rtl_test` can't open it: either the rtl-sdr tools aren't installed, or the
  DVB-T driver still holds it (blacklist `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu`, replug).
- **`available: true`** — good; the SDR tab and RF Waterfall button light up.

## Mesh overlays (Z-Wave / Meshtastic / MeshCore / LoRaWAN / Wi-Fi HaLow / Zigbee Suzi)

Both RF Waterfall panels (RTL-SDR and HackRF) have a **📡 Mesh / IoT bands** dropdown that
sweeps a chosen mesh's band and overlays its exact channel centres on the
spectrum, so you can watch the mesh's bursts/chirps land on its channels — device
chatter, retries, or a **jammer** parked on a channel.

- **Z-Wave** (FSK) — per-region channels (EU 868.42/869.85, US 908.42/916.0,
  US-LR 912/920, ANZ/JP/KR/IN/IL/HK/RU/CN). `GET /api/net/rtl/zwave`.
- **Meshtastic / MeshCore / LoRaWAN** (LoRa/CSS) — per protocol+region band +
  channels: Meshtastic US/EU868/EU433/ANZ, MeshCore EU/US, LoRaWAN
  EU868/US915/IN865/AS923. `GET /api/net/rtl/lora`.
- **Wi-Fi HaLow** (IEEE 802.11ah, OFDM) — sub-GHz Wi-Fi with 1–16 MHz
  channels: a higher-bandwidth alternative to LoRaWAN for IoT and long-range
  links. Presets per region, with the channel centres marked:

  | Preset | Band | Markers |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | US | 902–928 MHz | 13 × 2 MHz channels, 802.11ah numbering (centre = 902 + 0.5·n MHz, ch2…ch50) |
  | EU | 863–868 MHz | 1 MHz ch1/3/5/7/9 and 2 MHz ch2/6 (centre = 863 + 0.5·n MHz) |
  | AU/NZ | 915–928 MHz | the US 2 MHz channels inside the band (ch30…ch50) |
  | Japan | 916.5–927.5 MHz | 1 MHz raster |
  | Korea | 917.5–923.5 MHz | 1 MHz raster |
  | China | 779–787 MHz | 2 MHz raster (755–779 MHz is low-power only) |
  | India | 865–868 MHz | 1 MHz channels |
  | Singapore | 920–925 MHz | 1 MHz raster (866–869 MHz is also allowed) |

  1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 MHz channels share each band, so the markers are a reference
  grid, not a claim about which width a given network uses — the energy on the
  waterfall shows that.
- **Zigbee Suzi** — the sub-GHz feature of Zigbee 4.0 / Zigbee PRO 2023 from the
  Connectivity Standards Alliance (certification from 2026), running on IEEE
  802.15.4 sub-GHz radios for longer range than 2.4 GHz Zigbee:

  | Preset | Band | Markers |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | EU 868 | 863–870 MHz | IEEE 802.15.4 channel 0 at 868.3 MHz |
  | NA 915 | 902–928 MHz | IEEE 802.15.4 channels 1–10, 906–924 MHz, 2 MHz apart |

  The bands are the ones the Alliance names (868 MHz Europe, 915 MHz North
  America). **Suzi's own channel plan is in the Alliance's specification, which
  is not public**, so the markers are IEEE 802.15.4's published sub-GHz channels
  as a reference grid — not a claim that Suzi uses them. Read the real channels
  from where the energy lands.

**Naming what you click.** Click a burst in these bands and the measurement
labels it by width. LoRa never exceeds 500 kHz, so a signal 700 kHz or wider in
863–869, 902–928 or 779–787 MHz is *likely Wi-Fi HaLow or 802.15.4 / Zigbee
Suzi* — width alone cannot separate those two (HaLow is 1–16 MHz of OFDM; 802.15.4
at 915 MHz is 1–2 MHz). A burst between 90 and 700 kHz is *likely LoRa, or an FSK
mesh such as Zigbee Suzi*.

**This is an energy / occupancy view, not a decoder — and deliberately so:**

- **Wi-Fi HaLow and Zigbee Suzi are not demodulated either** — HaLow is 802.11
  OFDM and WPA3-encrypted; Suzi is 802.15.4 with Zigbee's AES-128 network
  encryption. Presence, channel and width are what you get.
- **LoRa cannot be demodulated with `rtl_power`/`rtl_433`.** LoRa is chirp
  spread-spectrum; demodulating it needs `gr-lora_sdr` (GNU Radio — heavy) or a
  real LoRa radio (SX127x/SX126x). This view never claims to read LoRa frames.
- **The payloads are encrypted anyway** — Meshtastic AES-256 (channel PSK;
  the *public* channel key is well-known), LoRaWAN AES-128. So even a demodulator
  gives you addresses/metadata at best, not message contents.
- **What you get RF-only:** presence, activity/occupancy per channel, and which
  band a mesh is on. Not node IDs or messages.
- **To actually identify/enumerate a mesh** (node list, names, and to read the
  Meshtastic public channel), use the **Mesh Nodes** page below — a companion
  Meshtastic node over USB does the LoRa demod the RTL-SDR can't.

Frequencies: LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi HaLow entries follow the published regional band plans; Meshtastic
default channels are preset/hash-derived and MeshCore's are user-configurable, so
those are marked "~" / "default" — scan the band for the actual chirps.

## Mesh Nodes (Meshtastic companion node)

The spectrum overlay shows *where* a LoRa mesh is; the **Mesh Nodes** page
(`/mesh-nodes`, `meshtastic_node.py`) shows *who's on it*. A cheap Meshtastic
device (Heltec / RAK / LILYGO T-Beam …) plugged into **USB** (or reached over
**WiFi** on TCP 4403) does the LoRa demodulation in hardware, and the
`meshtastic` Python API hands Ragnar the decoded mesh. USB auto-detect only
considers Meshtastic USB chips that no other component holds. It never takes
a GPS (u-blox/Prolific) or the CYD port, and it asks you to pick when several
qualify. The meshtastic library's own auto-detect would otherwise fall back to
*any* serial port, so it isn't used. The same link feeds the
[Wardrift mesh reporter](wardriving.md#wardrift-mesh-node-meshtastic):

- **Node DB** — id, long/short name, hardware model, role, SNR, hops away,
  battery/voltage, GPS position, last-heard. Plotted on a compact node radar
  (self at centre, links coloured by SNR) plus a full table.
- **🗺 Full map view** (`/mesh-map`, `demos/mesh_map.html`) — a full-screen
  **Leaflet** slippy map (vendored `web/vendor/leaflet`, key-free dark
  Esri / OSM / satellite tile layers — no API key, like the wardrive map) with
  clustered node markers, popups (hw/role/SNR/hops/battery), SNR-coloured links
  from your node, and Fit/Links controls. Fed by the same serial+MQTT node data,
  so it works with a node or MQTT-only. Reached from the Mesh Nodes toolbar. Map
  tiles need Internet (CSP allows remote `https:` images); markers still render
  on the dark base when offline.
- **🌍 World** — one button connects the **public MQTT broker** on its global
  topic and zooms the map out to the whole planet: **public mesh nodes worldwide**
  stream in and cluster as they beacon.
  - **Encrypted feed decoded.** The MQTT subscription is `msh/+/2/#`, covering
    both the JSON stream *and* the encrypted protobuf stream (`/e/`) that carries
    most nodes — few gateways enable JSON, so JSON-only saw almost nothing.
    `parse_mqtt_protobuf` hand-parses the ServiceEnvelope→MeshPacket→Data
    protobuf wire format (no protobuf/meshtastic dependency) and AES-CTR-decrypts
    the public-channel payload with the well-known default key. Private-channel
    packets don't decrypt and are dropped, so only shareable public traffic shows.
  - **Viewport-prioritised.** The map sends its current bounds
    (`/api/net/mesh/nodes?s=&w=&n=&e=`) and reloads on pan/zoom, so a zoomed-in
    view loads just that area instead of the whole world; results are capped
    most-recent-first, and MQTT positions are capped (`_MQTT_STATION_MAX`).
  - Still a large *live sample* (nodes appear as they beacon; RF-only/private
    nodes never reach MQTT), not a full census.
- **Public-channel messages** — the default Meshtastic channel key is
  well-known, so its text traffic is decoded and shown live. Private channels
  stay encrypted.
- **MQTT (Internet bridge)** — Meshtastic gateways bridge the mesh to an MQTT
  broker the way APRS IGates bridge to APRS-IS. The **☁ MQTT** button connects a
  broker (default the public `mqtt.meshtastic.org`, JSON topic `msh/+/2/json/#`)
  and streams mesh traffic **worldwide with no node at all** — nodes, positions
  and text messages parsed from the JSON stream (`parse_mqtt_json`). Runs
  independently of the USB node and of the RTL-SDR. Uses **paho-mqtt** (in
  `requirements.txt`; the Install button grabs it too).
- **Transmit** — the **Send** box puts a text message onto the mesh: through the
  connected node's **LoRa RF** when a node is present (licence-free ISM), else
  over **MQTT** (which reaches RF only via a downlink-enabled gateway). Messages
  you send show in the feed tagged `TX`; RF/serial and MQTT sources are tagged
  too.
- **Own USB radio** — this does *not* contend for the RTL-SDR, so it can run
  alongside the sub-GHz sweep / ADS-B.
- **Needs the `meshtastic` pip package** (serial) and **paho-mqtt** (MQTT) —
  installed best-effort by the installer/updater; if missing, the page shows an
  **⬇ Install meshtastic** button (`POST /api/net/mesh/install`, installs both).
- **MeshCore:** its companion tooling is still immature, so only the spectrum
  overlay covers it for now; node enumeration here is Meshtastic.

> Meshtastic transmit is licence-free ISM (unlike ham APRS), so sending through
> your own node is fine; over MQTT, mind the network's etiquette (don't flood
> the public broker). Public-channel traffic is readable; private channels stay
> encrypted.

## ADS-B radar (1090 MHz aircraft)

The RTL-SDR's other classic trick: at **1090 MHz** it hears the ADS-B position
broadcasts every airliner (and most GA) sends in the clear — ICAO address,
callsign, lat/lon, altitude, speed, heading. The **ADS-B Radar** page
(`/adsb-radar`, `adsb.py` driving **dump1090**) renders them on a PPI radar:
range rings, compass, your receiver at centre, and altitude-coloured blips with
heading vectors + a contacts table.

- **Reachable** from the RF Waterfall page ("✈ ADS-B Radar") and the Wi-Fi
  Spectrum Analyzer button (shown when an RTL-SDR is present or the demo is on).
- **Set your lat/lon** (or use the browser location) so range/bearing are
  correct — aircraft carry their own GPS position; the page computes distance and
  bearing relative to you client-side.
- **Each contact is identified three ways:** the **ICAO** callsign (e.g.
  `DLH427`); the airline's **IATA** flight + name looked up from a cross-reference
  table (`LH427 · Lufthansa` — ICAO and IATA are separate code systems, so this
  is a lookup, not a conversion); and the **tail registration** + country decoded
  from the ICAO 24-bit address (exact N-number algorithm for the US; country from
  the ICAO address block elsewhere).
- **Aircraft type** (`A320`, `B738`, `B77W`…) fills the **Type** column: ADS-B
  doesn't broadcast type, so it's looked up by ICAO hex from **adsb.lol** (free,
  no key) in the background and cached to `data/adsb_types.json` (gitignored), so
  the column fills in over a few seconds and is instant thereafter.
- **My location** (receiver position): the box's own **GPS** is the only trusted
  auto-source (the shared wardriving `/api/wardriving/gps`, so no second serial
  reader — and it's exactly where the antenna is). Browsers also expose
  geolocation, but only on secure (HTTPS) origins. **There is no IP geolocation** —
  it can place you hundreds of km off (ISPs register address ranges centrally),
  which silently plots aircraft at the wrong spot. With no GPS and no manual entry,
  the scope **self-centers on the aircraft it is actually receiving** (they are all
  within radio range, so their centroid is a good stand-in for the receiver — the
  centre dot turns amber and ranges are relative). Type a lat/lon into **My lat /
  My lon** for true, absolute range rings; it's saved in the browser.
- **Hearing nothing?** If the SDR is running but decodes no aircraft (common with a
  poor/indoor 1090 MHz antenna), the radar says so plainly — *"No aircraft in
  range"* with the live message count — rather than showing anything fake. As soon
  as a real contact is decoded it appears. Tip: a 1090 MHz antenna with real sky
  view (by/outside a window, away from the Pi and USB-3) makes the difference; a
  quarter-wave is ≈6.9 cm, 3/4-wave ≈20.7 cm.
- **No SDR? (demo)** With the RF-waterfall demo on and no dump1090, the radar and
  route maps show the **real** aircraft near you, pulled live from **adsb.lol**
  (`/api/net/adsb/nearby`) — real positions, types and routes — falling back to a
  synthetic sky only with no location or no internet. Mode reads **internet**. A
  real running SDR never shows the demo/internet feed — it shows only what it hears.
- **One dongle:** ADS-B uses the whole RTL-SDR, so starting the radar stops the
  sub-GHz sweep/decoder and vice-versa.
- **Needs `dump1090`** (any fork: dump1090-fa / dump1090-mutability / dump1090).
  The installer/updater install it best-effort; if it's missing the page shows an
  **⬇ Install dump1090** button (POSTs `/api/net/adsb/install`). Everything here
  is receive-only, and ADS-B is unauthenticated/unencrypted by design — the same
  data every flight-tracking site shows.

### Flight routes (click a contact → world map)

ADS-B carries the live position but **not** the filed route (origin →
destination). Click any contact (row or blip) and Ragnar opens a **world-map
route view**, FlightAware-style:

- **Origin/destination** come from a lookup on the callsign via
  [adsbdb.com](https://www.adsbdb.com) — **free, no API key**. Answers are cached
  to `data/adsb_routes.json` (gitignored). Clicking an aircraft is a deliberate,
  low-volume action, so a **live click always fetches the current answer from
  adsbdb** rather than trusting a stored copy — adsbdb keys routes on the
  *callsign*, a per-day fact (callsigns are reused across legs), so a stale cached
  route would confidently show the wrong destination. The cache serves as the
  **offline/failure fallback**: if adsbdb is unreachable the last stored route
  still draws, honestly tagged *"from local cache (adsbdb unreachable — may be out
  of date)"*. A cache entry older than ~12 h (`_ROUTE_TTL`) is refreshed on the
  next online look-up. Still on-demand only — no background polling.
- The map is **Leaflet** with **Esri dark-gray tiles** — the same vendored
  library (`/web/vendor/leaflet/`) and basemap as the **Mesh Map**, for one
  consistent map UX across Ragnar. It auto-fits (`fitBounds`) to the route, draws
  the true **great-circle** arc (curved, not a straight line) as a sampled
  polyline, splits it **flown** (cyan) vs **remaining** (dashed) at the live
  position, and marks both airports (labelled) and the aircraft (heading-oriented
  marker). The basemap tiles need connectivity like any slippy map; the route
  data itself is cached, so a known route still draws its line/markers offline.
- The plane is placed at its **real live position** and its **type** is shown:
  clicking fetches the flight from **adsb.lol** by hex, so the marker matches
  reality (not a stale/synthetic local fix). The side panel shows **% progress**,
  distance flown / remaining / total, a rough **ETA** from ground speed, and
  current altitude/speed — recomputed as the plane moves.
- **Stale-route guard:** adsbdb keys routes on the *callsign*, which is the
  *scheduled* route — but a callsign is reused across legs/days, so the aircraft
  flying it right now may be on a different (or return) leg, and adsbdb then hands
  back a confidently-wrong destination. Ragnar cross-checks the filed route against
  the aircraft's **real live heading**: if it is well en-route yet flying *away*
  from the filed destination (>100° off), the route is drawn faded/amber and the
  panel warns *"Filed route may be stale"* (progress/ETA are hidden, since they'd
  be meaningless). The live position stays accurate — only the filed route is
  flagged. Exposed as `route_match: {ok, delta}` on `/flight`.
- **Offline / unknown callsign:** the live position still plots on the map; the
  panel notes no filed route was found (adsbdb had no match, or you're offline).
  Backed by `GET /api/net/adsb/flight?hex=…&callsign=…&lat=&lon=&gs=`
  (`adsb.flight()` = adsbdb route + adsb.lol live position/type); the older
  `/api/net/adsb/route` remains. Pure parsers/geometry are covered by
  `adsb.py selftest` (24/24).

## Session record & replay

The sub-GHz waterfall toolbar has a **● Rec** button that captures the running
power sweep to a JSONL file under `data/rf_recordings/` (gitignored), and a
**Replay** dropdown to load any past recording back into the waterfall with a
transport bar (play/pause, seek, restart, delete). Frames are small, so a
recording is cheap; capped at a few thousand frames. Routes:
`/api/net/rtl/record/{start,stop,status,list,get,delete}`.

## Local Radio (listen: FM / NFM / AM / SSB / CW)

The RF Waterfall page has a **📻 Local Radio** bar: type a frequency, pick a mode
(**FM** broadcast, **NFM** narrowband, **AM**, **USB**/**LSB** single sideband,
or **CW** Morse — received as USB 700 Hz below the carrier, so it sounds as a
clean tone), and press **Listen**. A **squelch** slider mutes the audio until a
signal beats the level (the stream is padded with silence while it's closed, so
the player doesn't stall), and **● Rec** saves what you're hearing to an audio
file while you keep listening. `radio.py`
runs `rtl_fm` to demodulate and streams the audio to the browser
(`/api/net/radio/stream?freq_hz=…&mode=…`) that an `<audio>` element plays, with a
volume slider and band presets (FM broadcast, airband AM, marine/PMR NFM, MW).
Clicking a signal on the waterfall picks the likely mode for that frequency.
Frequencies below 24 MHz use the dongle's direct-sampling mode (MW/SW AM,
best-effort); bias-T, direct sampling and the converter offset from the
waterfall's settings apply here too. Narrow modes are demodulated at 12 kHz and
resampled to 48 kHz for the browser (`radio.audio_rate(mode)` reports the rate a
mode really produces, since `rtl_fm`'s `-r` only resamples downwards). One dongle, so listening pauses the sub-GHz sweep. `rtl_fm` ships
in the already-installed `rtl-sdr` package. Receive-only.

**Format — phone-friendly:** when `ffmpeg` is present the PCM is transcoded to a
live **MP3** stream (`audio/mpeg`), which plays in every browser including **iOS
Safari** / mobile — an open-ended streaming WAV does not play on iOS (its media
loader needs a range-able/finite resource), so WAV is only the desktop fallback
when `ffmpeg` is missing. `radio.detect()` reports the active `format` and
`mimetype`. `ffmpeg` is a standard package (add with `apt install ffmpeg`).

## Pager Decode (POCSAG / FLEX)

Pagers are still everywhere — hospitals, industrial SCADA/telemetry, alarms,
on-call teams — and **POCSAG/FLEX are transmitted in the clear**. The **Pager
Decode** page (`/pager-decode`, `pagerdecode.py`) tunes a pager channel with
`rtl_fm` and decodes it with `multimon-ng`, showing each message's capcode
(address), function bits, and alphanumeric/numeric text, live. A second mode
adds **Motorola Quick Call II** (two-tone sequential, fire/EMS dispatch),
decoded in-process (no multimon-ng) — see `qcii_detect` in `pagerdecode.py`.

> Note: the decoder is `pagerdecode.py`, deliberately **not** `pager.py` — a
> separate `pager/` package (a physical pager-device UI) already owns the
> `pager` import name, so the decoder module was renamed to avoid the clash.

- **Channels** — a preset list of common POCSAG/FLEX frequencies plus a
  free-form MHz box. Uses the current PPM/gain tuning. `rtl_fm` runs with its
  low-leakage downsample filter (`-F 9`) for cleaner narrowband FM, and
  multimon-ng with `-u` (prune statistically unlikely decodes).
- **Baud / demod selector** — POCSAG has three on-air baud rates (512 / 1200 /
  2400), each a *separate* multimon-ng demodulator; **FLEX** is one demodulator
  that auto-detects its own speed (1600 / 3200 / 6400 baud, 2- or 4-level). The
  page's **Baud** checkboxes choose which demods run (`{demods:[…]}` on the start
  API). This is the main cure for **garbage output**: on a FLEX-only channel,
  leaving the POCSAG demods enabled makes multimon slice noise into junk
  "POCSAG" pages — untick the protocols the channel doesn't carry and the
  garbage stops. Defaults to all four (512/1200/2400 + FLEX).
- **Invert** — the **Invert** toggle adds multimon's `-i` (flip the demodulated
  bitstream), multimon's own advice for a channel that decodes but comes out
  scrambled (mis-polarised signal). `{invert:true}` on the start API.
- **`multimon-ng`** is in the Debian/Pi OS apt repos, so the installer/updater
  install it cleanly; if missing, the page shows an **⬇ Install multimon-ng**
  button (`POST /api/net/pager/install`).
- **One dongle** — pager decode uses `rtl_fm` (the whole RTL-SDR), so starting
  it stops the sub-GHz sweep/decoder and ADS-B (and vice-versa).
- **Legality** — pager traffic is unencrypted but frequently *sensitive*
  (patient data, security callouts). Decode third-party traffic only where
  lawful; this is receive-only.

## ACARS datalink (on the ADS-B radar)

The ADS-B radar page has an **✉ ACARS datalink** panel. ACARS is the VHF text
system airliners use for ops — position reports, OOOI (out/off/on/in) times,
weather, load sheets, and free-text crew↔ops messages — transmitted in the clear
around **131 MHz**. `acars.py` drives `acarsdec` and shows each message's tail,
flight, label (+ its meaning), text, and frequency/level. Messages are matched to
the radar contacts by tail/flight and flagged **● on radar**.

- **One dongle** — ACARS (131 MHz) and the 1090 MHz radar can't run at once, so
  starting ACARS pauses the radar (and vice-versa). The panel has its own
  Start/Stop.
- **`acarsdec`** isn't in apt, so the installer/updater build it from source
  (`scripts/install_acarsdec.sh`); if missing, the panel shows an **⬇ Install
  acarsdec** button. Receive-only.

## VDL Mode 2 / ATN datalink (on the ADS-B radar)

The ADS-B radar page also has a **📡 VDL Mode 2 / ATN** panel — the modern
successor to VHF ACARS. Where legacy ACARS is a character link at ~131 MHz, VDL
Mode 2 is a 31.5 kbit/s D8PSK link on a handful of **136 MHz** channels
(worldwide Common Signalling Channel **136.975**, plus 136.725/136.775/136.800/
136.825). `vdl2.py` drives **`dumpvdl2`** (built against **`libacars`**) and
classifies every frame into one of:

- **ACARS-over-VDL2** — the same ops messages (position, OOOI, weather, load
  sheets, free text) riding VDL2 instead of the old VHF link.
- **CPDLC** (Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications) — the **ATN** text
  between controllers and pilots: climb/descend/heading/speed clearances,
  `CONTACT <freq>`, `MONITOR <unit>`, logon/handoff, `WILCO`/`ROGER`. Decoded by
  libacars. This is the part that makes Ragnar, as far as we know, the first
  field tool to surface CPDLC/ADS-C alongside an ADS-B radar.
- **ADS-C** (Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Contract) — contracted
  position/intent reports an aircraft sends to an ATC ground system.

Each row shows the aircraft (tail/ICAO/flight, flagged **● on radar** when it
matches a contact), a coloured **type badge**, the **direction** (↑ uplink =
ground→aircraft, ↓ downlink = aircraft→ground), the decoded text/summary, and
frequency/level.

- **One dongle** — VDL2 (136 MHz) can't run with the 1090 MHz radar or the
  131 MHz ACARS panel; starting it pauses the others (and vice-versa).
- **`dumpvdl2` + `libacars`** aren't in apt (not even on Debian trixie), so the
  installer/updater build both from source (`scripts/install_dumpvdl2.sh`); if
  missing, the panel shows an **⬇ Install dumpvdl2** button. Everything is in the
  clear, receive-only.
- **If the build fails**, the script now prints the real cmake/compiler error and
  which step failed (deps → libacars → dumpvdl2), so you can tell a Pi problem
  from a package problem. The usual culprit on a small Pi is the parallel compile
  running the board **out of RAM** (the OOM killer kills `cc1`): the script
  auto-retries single-threaded, but if that still fails, add a swap file
  (`sudo dphys-swapfile ...` or a 1 GB `/swapfile`) and retry. Other causes it
  reports plainly: no internet (git clone fails) or a failed `apt-get update`.
- Pure parsers (ACARS/CPDLC/ADS-C classification, direction, nested-tree
  extraction) are covered by `vdl2.py selftest` (13/13).

## VOR radial decode (108–118 MHz nav beacon)

The **VOR Radial** page (`/vor-radial`, `vor.py`) decodes a VOR nav beacon the
way an aircraft's receiver does, and shows the **radial** you're on — the
magnetic bearing *from* the station — on a compass rose.

A VOR transmits two 30 Hz tones: a **reference** (FM-modulated on a 9960 Hz
subcarrier, the same phase in every direction) and a **variable** (AM-modulated
by the station's rotating pattern, so its phase equals your bearing). The phase
difference between them *is* the radial. `rtl_fm -M am` gives the composite
audio; `vor_decode` recovers the variable 30 Hz straight from it and the
reference 30 Hz by FM-demodulating the 9960 Hz subcarrier, then reports
`(reference_phase − variable_phase) mod 360`. It's pure numpy DSP (no scipy) —
`vor.selftest` recovers synthesised radials to <2°.

- **Cal°** — a fixed offset added to the radial, to trim a receiver/site bias.
- **One dongle** — VOR uses `rtl_fm` (the whole RTL-SDR), so it's mutually
  exclusive with the sweep/ISM, ADS-B, pager, ACARS and radio.
- **Not for navigation** — a hobby SDR + wire antenna is a demonstrator, not a
  certified nav receiver. Receive-only.

## APRS (ham packet + messaging)

The **APRS** page (`/aprs`, `aprs.py`) receives APRS — the ham packet network of
position beacons, weather, telemetry and short **messages** — from two sources
into one station map + packet feed + message view:

- **RF (SDR)** — `rtl_fm | multimon-ng -a AFSK1200` decodes the local APRS
  channel (144.390 MHz North America, 144.800 Europe, 145.175 Australia, …; a
  region picker sets the frequency, or type your own MHz). Receive-only; no
  licence needed to listen.
- **APRS-IS (Internet)** — a TCP client to the global network
  (`rotate.aprs2.net:14580`). A **read-only** login (no callsign) streams **any
  region** via a server filter (`r/lat/lon/km`); with **your own callsign +
  passcode** you get **write access to send messages**, which IGates near the
  recipient relay onward. The passcode is the standard APRS-IS callsign hash
  (`aprs.aprs_passcode`).

`parse_aprs` handles uncompressed & compressed positions (with/without
timestamp), **Mic-E**, messages/acks, objects, status and best-effort weather —
13 selftests including a Mic-E round-trip and the passcode algorithm.

- **One dongle** — RF APRS shares the RTL-SDR with the sweep / ISM / ADS-B /
  pager / VOR / radio, so starting one stops the others. **APRS-IS is
  independent** (Internet only) and keeps running regardless — so the page is
  useful even with no dongle at all.
- **No RF transmit** — RTL-SDR can't transmit and HackRF TX (licence + amp/
  filter care) is deliberately out of scope; APRS-IS carries the messaging.
  Sending still injects under your callsign on the ham network — **only licensed
  operators should send.**

## Legality

Listening is passive, but decoding third-party device telemetry (TPMS, meters,
sensors) can be regulated where you live. Use it on your own devices and within
local law.
